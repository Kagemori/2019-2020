Running GalaxSee

GalaxSee is designed to be run from a command line unix
prompt. It solves for the collapse of a rotating group
of objects bound by gravity. You can specify the number
of masses, the mass per object, the running time
for the model, and whether or not to visualize
the results.

It is designed to be run as an MPI program. Typically
you would run the program with a command such as

mpirun -np 4 -machinefile ./machines GalaxSee 1000 200 1000 1

for a 4 node cluster with a machines file specified in the
local directory, running 1000 objects of 200 solar
masses each for 1000 Myears, displaying the results
as an X window.
